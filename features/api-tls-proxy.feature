Feature: TLS material and proxies
  strictSSL is off by default; with it, the ca option names what to trust. cert, key and
  passphrase present a client certificate. A proxy object or HTTP_PROXY / HTTPS_PROXY
  carry the checks through a proxy, unless proxy is false or NO_PROXY names the host.

  @kind:good
  Scenario: a self-signed server is accepted without strictSSL
    Given an HTTPS server with a self-signed certificate
    When the consumer calls waitOn with:
